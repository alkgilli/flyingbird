This was created as a way to help a beginner learn code and as a test to load something online to github. Through this I learned how to make a gif through Adobe Photoshop and hwo to make that compatible with Adobe Dreamweaver. Within photoshop I learned how to properly remove backgrounds and how to work with frames instead of layers.
